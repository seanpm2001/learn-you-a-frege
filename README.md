## How to Build

The project is built by Gradle and [Frege Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/Frege/frege-gradle-plugin). The Gradle wrapper is already committed in the repository, so what you have to do is execute:

```
$ ./gradlew compileFrege
```

Then you can find the generated `.java` and `.class` files under the `build/classes/main` directory.
